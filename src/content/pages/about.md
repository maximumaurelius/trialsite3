## About Me

## Welcome to My Blog
Hello! I'm Mahesh Bava, a resident doctor with a passion for exploring the intersection of science, lifestyle, and human connection. This is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and ideas on topics close to my heart.

## My Mission
Through this blog, I aim to:
- Share insights from my journey in medicine and beyond
- Connect with like-minded individuals who are curious and compassionate
- Document and reflect on my personal growth and professional experiences
- Promote conversations around lifestyle medicine, mental health, and innovation in healthcare

## Background
I’m a resident doctor with a strong interest in lifestyle medicine, psychedelic medicine, general surgery, and neurophysiology. Outside of medicine, I enjoy exploring technology, finance, and DJing. My perspective is shaped by a blend of professional expertise, curiosity, and a desire to make a positive impact.


Thanks for visiting—let's explore, learn, and grow together!
