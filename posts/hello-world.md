# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! This is a demonstration of how Markdown works in our simple static website.

## Features

Here are some of the Markdown features we support:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- [Links](https://example.com) to other resources
- Headers of different levels

## Code Examples

You can share code snippets like this:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
